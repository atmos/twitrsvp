  What is TwitRSVP?
  - unless current_user
    %span.context
      = "(<a href='/signup'>skip me to making an event!</a>)"
%p
  Wouldnâ€™t it be nice to use twitter to ask things like 
  %strong &ldquo;who wants to grab beers tonight?&rdquo;
  twitRSVP accommodates both ad-hoc twitter organization and planned meetups.
