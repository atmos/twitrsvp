%h1 What is TwitRSVP?

%p
  Wouldnâ€™t it be nice to 
  %strong use twitter to say things like &ldquo;who wants to grab beers at mountain sun?&rdquo;
  After talking to people we realized most people envisioned our service operating differently, 
  %strong we have set forth to accommodate both.
  We are interested in supporting both the ad-hoc twitter negotiation and the
  people who organize events in advance.

%h2 The basic setup involves the following steps.
%ul
  %li You decide on a time and place for the event.
  %li You visit the twitRSVP.com web interface to schedule the event.
  %li Invite up to 20 attendees to your event.
  %li twitRSVP.com direct messages the attendees on your behalf with the event info.
  %li Your Attendees can reply via the URL or the direct message by direct messaging the event organizer with the eventkey.
  %li You can even go back and edit who should be at the event, or if you put the wrong time!

  We've taken advantage of the 
  %a{:href => "http://twitter.com/oauth"} twitter oauth api
  to simplify a lot of things for you. Because why wouldn't we want to? Right?

    %strong If you're an organizer
    , your friends can reply via direct messages OR via the web. 
    %strong If you're an attendee
    , you can let your friends know whether you are going to attend or not, whether or not you have the fanciest phone. 
    %strong We're narrowcasting with twitRSVP
    , which means all of your friends aren't going to know that you're gonna grab some microbrews kinda early on a friday. Your friends that are meeting you though, 
    %strong they'll know you said you were gonna be there
    \.
  %p
    %strong We've actually given a lot of thought to the idea of extending this beyond twitter
    \.  Maybe we should invite folks via email who don't have twitter accounts?
    Maybe we should include some other crazy feature? Realistically you can build
    rich applications based on the twitter API without even considering things
    like... email. If you think about it, 
    %strong We think you'll be happy with our little product
    \.
