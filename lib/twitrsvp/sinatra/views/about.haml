%h2 Here's a quick run down of what twitRSVP is
%ul
  %li
    Really simple way to organize events with friends via 
    %a{:href => 'http://twitter.com'} twitter
  %li
    Don't be annoying.  Use twitter as a message bus and keep organization
    discreet.  Shoot your friends some direct messages with a time, place, and
    a way to say whether or not they'll be there.
  %li
    Use
    %a{:href => 'http://oauth.net'} oauth 
    to send messages on your behalf without requring you to provide your password.
  %li
    Confirmation via direct messaging.  When you're invited to an event you'll
    receive a 4 character confirmation code.  If your key is 'aXfg' then you
    simply reply, "yes aXfg " or "no aXfg" depending on whether or not you'll
    attend.
